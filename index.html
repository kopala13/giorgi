<h2> Diversity </h2>
<p>Dinosaurs were a highly diverse group of reptiles that lived during the Mesozoic Era. They came in various shapes and sizes, ranging from small, bird-like dinosaurs to enormous giants like the Brachiosaurus and Tyrannosaurus Rex.

       <h2> Birds Are Dinosaurs </h2>
       <p>Birds are considered living dinosaurs. They share a common ancestor with other dinosaurs and evolved from small, feathered theropods. This makes them the only surviving lineage of dinosaurs.<img src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.qybZWpnlE2rCJlYzAH8LSgHaMT&pid=Api&P=0&h=180"</p>
       <h2>Feathers</h2>
        <p> Some dinosaurs had feathers. The discovery of feathered dinosaur fossils, such as the Archaeopteryx, suggests that feathers likely evolved in dinosaurs for insulation and display purposes before being used for flight in birds<img src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.qybZWpnlE2rCJlYzAH8LSgHaMT&pid=Api&P=0&h=180"</p>
          <h2>Walking Speed</h2>
        <p>The walking speed of dinosaurs varied greatly. While some dinosaurs were slow-moving herbivores, others, like the Velociraptor, were agile and fast runners. The exact speeds are difficult to determine, but estimates suggest some dinosaurs could reach speeds of up to 30 mph (48 km/h).
